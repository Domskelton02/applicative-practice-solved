// SPACE DATA EXERCISE 4
// Return an array of Planets' names with gravity less than 10
// Return example: ['name1', 'name2', ... , 'nameN']

  // Your code goes here...
  // First, filter the planets to only include those with gravity less than 10
  return data.planets.filter(planet => planet.gravity < 10)
  // Then, map the filtered planets to an array of their names
  .map(planet => planet.name);

// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-4"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
